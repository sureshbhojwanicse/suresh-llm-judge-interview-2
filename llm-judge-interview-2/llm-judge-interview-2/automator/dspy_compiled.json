When they and the British were beaten, the Americans burned their crops and villages.  The Cherokee knew they could never win against Americans who were taking over their land so in 1795 they signed a treaty with the new United States government.  In the agreement, the Cherokee said they would stay on their lands in Georgia and other states peacefully.  In return, the US said that no white person could come into their lands without the permission of the Cherokee. \nLater during the War of 1812, the Cherokee actually helped the Americans fight against the British.  The Cherokee leader, Major Ridge, wanted his people to get along with Americans.  The problem was that in 1829, gold was found on Cherokee lands.  White settlers started to pour into the area which broke the treaty that the Cherokee had with the United States.  Andrew Jackson supported the settlers and asked Congress to remove the Cherokee.  The Cherokees were betrayed. \nIn 1830, the Cherokee gave white settlers a warning and told them they had to move out.  They then burned down the houses of the white settlers.  White settlers throughout Georgia became angry and started attacking the Cherokee in return.\n \n1\u2013 Based on this reading, identify 3 cause and effect relationships:\nA-\n \nB-\n \nC-\n\n\n[The Start of Reference Answer]\nA- Cause: The discovery of gold on Cherokee lands Effect: White settlers began to pour into the area, breaking the treaty between the Cherokee and the United States.\n\nB- Cause: Andrew Jackson's support for the white settlers Effect: Congress was asked to remove the Cherokee from their lands, leading to the betrayal of the Cherokee.\n\nC- Cause: The Cherokee warning white settlers to move out Effect: Retaliation from angry white settlers, who began attacking the Cherokee throughout Georgia.\n[The End of Reference Answer]\n\n[The Start of Candidate Answer]\nA- Cause: The Cherokee fought on the side of the British during the American Revolution. \n   Effect: After losing, their crops and villages were burned by the Americans, leading them to sign a treaty in 1795 agreeing to live peacefully on their lands.\n\nB- Cause: Gold was discovered on Cherokee lands in 1829.\n   Effect: White settlers flooded into Cherokee lands, violating the treaty made with the United States, which led to conflicts between the settlers and the Cherokee.\n\nC-\n[The End of Candidate Answer]\n\nDecide if the candidate answer is as good as the reference answer.",
